I like doing the "7 min" training as a warmup or just a really small daily routine to keep up the form. 

But to do this I constantly either had to watch this really annoying video, with long commercials and all (because I am a upstanding member of society which doesn't use add-blockers) or I had go to a web page showing it which is even more annoying given todays web-landscape. 

So I figured I should make a small application for it. 

Goals:
- Learn a little Rust. 
- Maybe learn to do cli animations. 
- Maybe some more training things later.
